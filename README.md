# Jabra Wireless Headsets Keep Connect (or Keep Alive)

A simple app to schedule the playing of a sound that prevents a Jabra device from going into standby mode (disconnecting).

The 20 Hz or 20.000 Hz tone should keep the headset active without impacting the audio experience.

### Build app

```bash
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile main.py
```
